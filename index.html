  <h1>Stock Market Forecasting using Time Series Analysis</h1>
  <p>When it comes to financial planning - one of the questions that every investor tries to find an answer to is to be able to understand the direction of the movement of the stock prices. The uncertainty in the movement of the prices of a company's stock can significantly impact the future of the company and it's investors. With the help of advanced data modeling and time series analysis tools available today, one can make an informed decision when it comes to planning by estimating outcomes like what stock to buy or whether stocks will be positive or negative. Let's try and see how these tools can be applied to real world data with the help of an example.</p>
  
  <h2>Real World Example</h2>
  <p>For explaining how time series analysis help in stock market forecasting, we will be using the real asset price data from a fictional company: Mediocre Social Network Apps Incorporated (MSN Apps). As per the the company's investors, MSN Apps has been struggling to maintain the value of its stock price for a few years. The investor are hoping that things might turn around in the near future, but they also want to be realistic with themselves as to take further decisions regarding their business. 
  
  We have the stock price for MSN Apps available from the beginning of 2015 through the end of September 2019. We will be applying time series tools to forecast the stock price for the first ten trading days of October 2019 to understand what the fourth quarter might hold for MSN Apps this year.
  
  First of all, let's begin by having an understanding the movement of it's stock price for the last few years

  Few of the observations from the stock movement: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is evident that there is an overall downward trend in the stock price as the prices have effectively been decreasing in the long run! </li>
    <li>There are variable fluctuations in the price movement - the change in price movement is not constant. This can be seen as a seasonal impact wherein there is a periodic pattern that is repeated based on calendar day, month, quarter, annual basis etcâ€¦ </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Intuitively, when we make decisions about the future of a company's stock prices, we rely our judgement on it's previous values. That's the same reasoning that goes behind the time series analysis. When forecasting the state of the stock for the future, we try and use the information from its previous values. This information broadly comprises of two things: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the <i> Trend </i> of the movement </li>
    <li>Understanding the <i> Seasonality </i> in the movement</li>
    <li>Understanding the behaviour of <i>Random Noise</i> in the price movement</li>
  </ul>
